Welcome to the Undergrad mentoring wiki! My goal is to centralize resources to act as a good starting point for undergraduates (_et al._) to write their first scientific paper. There are also resources related to non-native English speakers (my case), online courses that I have enjoyed, and advice on life in the sciences that might be useful for those thinking of pursuing a Masters or a Ph.D. I hope it is useful =) 

### On manuscript organization
* [How to structure your manuscript](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/11-steps-to-structuring-a-science-paper-editors-will-take-seriously)
