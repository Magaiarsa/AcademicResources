Welcome to the Undergrad mentoring wiki! My goal is to centralize resources to act as a good starting point for undergraduates (_et al._) to write their first scientific paper. There are also resources related to non-native English speakers (my case), online courses that I have enjoyed, and advice on life in the sciences that might be useful for those thinking of pursuing a Masters or a Ph.D. I hope it is useful =)
